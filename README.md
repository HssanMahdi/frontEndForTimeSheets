Before the days of Skype and Zoom calls, a NASA engineer by the name of Jack Nilles laid the foundation for modern remote working when he coined the term "telecommuting" in 1973. What may have seemed a fad when it first came about is now the norm. According to a Gartner survey, 74% of businesses are planning on shifting their employees to remote positions as part of their post-COVID plans. 
It’s no secret that working away from the office is increasingly more popular. Six out of 10 companies offer their workers the chance to telecommute and 43% of all employees work remotely at least some of the time, according to the latest workplace statistics from Gallup.
Remote work has seen a boom of 115% in the last decade and it has been becoming more and more popular in the last few years.
Studies have found remote workers are more productive, healthier, and enjoy a more positive work-life balance. The benefits for workers and businesses alike are driving a workplace revolution.
Remote work may be more common than it used to be, but it still comes with its challenges.
Researchers tracked the activity of more than 10,000 employees at an Asian services company between April 2019 and August 2020 and found that they were working 30 % more untracked hours than they were before the pandemic and 18 % more unpaid overtime hours and that means they are working more and paid less than expected so there is a problem of time tracking and a problem with the payroll.
The most common challenge remote teams report in studies is collaborating and communicating from different locations, teamwork feels fragmented and uneasy.
Now we’re getting into some of the more complex problems of managing remote teams. To hit big targets, you’ve got to make sure all the smaller tasks are getting completed in a timely manner. Managers must keep track of progress on individual tasks while also keeping a keen eye on project-wide progress.
